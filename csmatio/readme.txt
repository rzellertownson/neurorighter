CSMatIO is a .NET Library to read, write, and manipulate Matlab binary
MAT-files.

CSMatIO is a managed version of the Matlab MAT-File I/O API written entirly in C#.  As is with
most of my projects, CSMatIO was originally intended as a small support application for my Ph.D.
research, but quickly grew out of control into a full API.  CSMatIO was orinally based off of 
converting the Java source code to C# from the JMatIO library written by Wojciech Gradkowski, 
but eventually grew morphed into its current version.  Mr. Gradkowski's CSMatIO is, I am sure,
an excellent utility, but unfortionately is imcompatable with Microsoft's .NET Architecture.

This library was written for people who develope .NET applications and would like to import or
export there data into Matlab for further processing or to use Matlabs superior graphing 
capabilities.  It was written with Visual Studio .NET 2005 and requires the .NET 2.0 
Architecture set to be installed.

If you would like to send comments, improvement requests, or to criticize the project please

Enjoy!
