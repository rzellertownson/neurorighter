CSMatIO is a .NET Library to read, write, and manipulate Matlab binary
MAT-files.

CSMatIO is a managed version of the Matlab MAT-File I/O API written entirely in C#.  As is with most of my projects, CSMatIO based initially on converting the Java source code to C# from the JMatIO library that is written by Wojciech Gradkowski. It was used as a small support application for my Ph.D. research, but quickly grew out of control into a full API. 
Mr. Gradkowski's CSMatIO is an excellent utility but unfortunately is incompatible with Microsoft's .NET Architecture.

This library is for people who are developing .NET applications and would like to import or export their data into Matlab for further processing or to use Matlabs superior graphing capabilities.  It was written with Visual Studio .NET 2005 and required the .NET 2.0 
Architecture set to be installed.

If you would like to send comments, improvement requests, or to criticize the project, please

Enjoy!
